This allows users to easily access their saved photos for free anywhere the bot is, through simple commands on the fly. The bot was developed using C#, is hosted through Azure App Services and hosts all of its data using Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL). Users can also access their data through a website developed with ASP.NET MVC.",

The game was created with C#, used WinUI 3 for the desktop version and Blazor WebAssembly for the web version. The game's logic was implemented as a separate modular library that was published as a NuGet package. This allows developers to easily make their own Minesweeper versions, with their own UIs, on any platform that supports .NET (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc). The desktop version of the app was previously published on the Microsoft Store and had over 12,592 downloads.",

The solution is implemented by hosting a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container on one of the machines. Then all the machines have bash scripts installed that collect static hardware specifications at install time and performance statistics every minute through a cron job.",

I have been programming for over 10 years and through that time I have gained experience with everything from Windows application development to web development and bots. I studied at Wilfrid Laurier University, for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Mathematics Minor. I have made many pieces of software not only for fun but, to also solve serious problems my peers and I face. While I am most experienced with C++, C# and the .NET tech stack, I know many other technologies and languages. I find learning new technologies and creating new projects with them, incredibly fun and rewarding. Not only this but, I'm also a natural learner so, I will never have any problems developing software for any language or tech stack asked of me."
