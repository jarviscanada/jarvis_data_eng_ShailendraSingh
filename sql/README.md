# Introduction
This project was explictly done as a practice exercise. In this exercise, three tables are setup called `cd.members`, `cd.bookings` and 
`cd.facilities`, with thousands of sample records placed inside. These tables were then used in 28 practice questions. As answers to these
questions, I crafted queries that practiced the fundementals of SQL such as Inserts, Deletes, Joins, Unions, Aggregation functions, Window functions and more.

# SQL Queries

###### Table Setup (DDL)
The tables and data were setup via the `clubdata.sql` script, using the following command:

`psql -h [HOSTNAME] -p [PORT #] -U [USERNAME] -f clubdata.sql`

###### Questions
All questions alongside their answers are listed in the `queries.sql` file.
